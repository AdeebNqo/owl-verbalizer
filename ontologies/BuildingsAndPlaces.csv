ignored	Annotation(http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/v1/BuildingsAndPlaces.owl#purpose,^^(The purpose of Ordnance Survey’s Buildings and Places Ontology is to describe the building feature and place classes surveyed by Ordnance Survey with the intention of improving the use of the surveyed data by our customers in an unambiguous manner and enabling semi-automatic processing of these data. Note at present there is no definition of place with existing operational functions of OS. In OS terms place represents all complex areas where a specific activity can be associated with that area on a more or less permanent basis for example functional sites (hospital, school, etc.), car parks, playing fields etc.,))

ignored	Annotation(http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/v1/BuildingsAndPlaces.owl#scope,^^(The ontology describes buildings and places that are topographically relevant – I.e. which are sufficiently important to be recognised and recorded by Ordnance Survey surveyors. Crudely buildings are defined as fixed permanent roofed structures and places as “where something happens”. The scope is extended to cover the identification of such buildings and places (e.g. in terms of naming or addressing) and the main activities that may occur in such buildings and places. Also in scope are significant topological or mereological relationships and spatial extent where this is definable. Out of scope are buildings smaller than 5m2, parts of buildings (all uses are assumed to occur within a building without specifying where) other than through inference (i.e. the assignment of multiple addresses to a building). Also is out of scope places that are located within buildings. In this ontology, place is regarded from a topographic sense. Historical use of a building is considered in scope where the form is distinctive e.g. a lighthouse now used as a hotel.,))
