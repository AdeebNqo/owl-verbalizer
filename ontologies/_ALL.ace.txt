Purpose: To describe in an unambiguous manner the inland hydrology feature classes surveyed by Ordnance Survey with the intention of improving the use of the surveyed data by our customers and enabling semi-automatic processing of these data. Feature terms have primarily been taken from the Ordnance Survey Master Map Real World Objects Catalogue [1], however new terms have also been added in order to ensure the completeness of the domain. The feature definitions have also been taken from Ordnance Survey Master Map Real World Objects Catalogue [1] but they have been completed and modified where descriptions were insufficient. The sources of the additional definitions are noted after each definition. The ontology modules (Spatial relations, Network relations, Language relations, Political geography and Mereology) include only those relationships and concepts that were directly relevant to the Hydrology ontology.
